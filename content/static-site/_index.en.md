MarkdownSite supports static websites.  Ensure that the contents of your site are in the `public/` directory of the git repo.

Commit your repository to your git provider and then go to [MarkdownSite.com](https://markdownsite.com/) and enter the git URL that is used to clone the repository.

Click **Build My Site** and you will be brought to the status page for your MarkdownSite and it will be rebuilding.

If you use an **ssh** clone URL, MarkdownSite may need to be given access to your repository.  You can find [the public key here](https://markdownsite.com/sshkey.txt).
