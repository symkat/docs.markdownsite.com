MarkdownSite is an open-source project.  You can [view & download the source from GitHub](https://github.com/symkat/MarkdownSite).  There is documentation and setup systems to get an MDS network up and running, as well as for on-going configuration management of a running network.  Additional graphs explain how the various systems interact.

I invite you to setup your own network.

#### Open-Source - Motevation

I have always had a deep affinity for this aspect of computer technology.  To express my facination as simply as I can: That one can express an idea, **as information**, and store it in a computer.  That another can have **the information**, retrieved from a computer.  It does not have to be the same computer, and the computers never need to have directly been connected to one another.

MarkdownSite is an idea I have about how a web hosting platform could be run.  I hope that this information is helpful to those who are reading this, as so much in the open-source community has been helpful to me.

#### Open-Source - Money

I would like to contribute to the open source community and make a living at the same time, and I believe that is possible.

If you like MarkdownSite and would like to see more of this type of work, please consider contributing on [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/symkat).
